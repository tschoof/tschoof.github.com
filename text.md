Timm studies law at the University of Hamburg. Currently, however, he is studying at Trinity College, Dublin. [Erasmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_programme) is awesome.

He has a [blog](http://blog.timmschoof.com) and is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tschoof) and  [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/tschoof).  
You can also send him an <a href="mailto:hello@timmschoof.com">email</a> or contact him via [Facebook](http://facebook.com/tschoof), if that's something you're interested in.

Sometimes, he posts photos on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/timm_schoof/).

He doesn't really know programming, but uses [Github](https://github.com/tschoof) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for this website thing.
